### Every great tale has a backstory

Taku is the second child in his family, his family is a picturesque nuclear family.

His Dad taints that picture one day, his Dad cheats on his mom. Taku learns to despise his Dad because he makes his Mom cry.
As with everything in life, the happiness in their family withers away and dies. 

### Where it all began
They are six years old when he meets her at the city park, she is plucking petals off a flower that is colored like the stuff that comes out when he cuts himself with a blade (mama calls it blood, he calls it juice, mama also says it is blue in color).

"Hello" he shouts a bit too eagerly and she jolts. The flower in her hands is squeezed in fright, so he plucks another off its stalk, rosy as he cradles it in his hands, he gives it too her.

"My name is Taku, what is yours?"

She doesn't tell him, instead saying he has to earn it. Because her princess movies tell her that a lady has to guard her name like a treasure.

He vows that he will earn it, she only giggles and returns to plucking petals off flowers. He asks if he can join her, even though he doesn't understand what she is doing.

"One day" she promises halfheartedly hoping he will stop bothering her. He doesn't.

He returns the next day and the day after and the day after that, eventually establishing a routine.

---

"It's a game".

She eventually says when the weekend hangout becomes casual. A new routine.

He likes routine a lot.

She smiles fully as she explains the rules of the game and he can see that she's also missing a front tooth, changing. She make Taku feel less lonely about his missing front tooth, but she has always made him feel less lonely in general. This much he doesn't understand.

"Why not just ask them" He asks when she is done, not getting the point of the game.

"People lie you know" and it is obvious that she is repeating words she once heard, not that Taku knows.

"Nature doesn't "She continues and he makes an effort to make eye contact.

He doesn't get it, but he thinks he can someday.

"Oh" He adds because long pauses make him uncomfortable. "Oh" he repeats to let her know that he understands. Sort of

"It's the last petal that decides your fate. Always"

"Always" He repeats in his head because she knows more than he does and being around her means learning new things.

He likes learning new things.

He likes her

---

Soon school resumes and he discovers she is a grade above him, he thinks it's quite fitting.

One day he approaches her during lunch break, she is with her friend whose name he learns is Rahma, a friend of a friend is a friend he decides and Rahma becomes a precious person. 

---

Soon he is 7 then he is 8. 

The situation at home does not improve. It is obvious his mom takes his Dad's betrayal really hard and slowly, as surely as flowers do, her heart withers away slowly, Taku wants to help but he doesn't know how. Taku learns to despise his Dad more. His mom also starts working night shifts at the hospital, leaving Taku to care for his sisters, Taku is forced to mature. He loses whatever semblance of a childhood he has, that's okay though he still has his friends at school.

The neighbors complain about him more frequently saying he is a problem child. Once one of them holds his hand and he jerks his hand away.

"See? Problem child" He wants to rage and tell them he is an adult now, but he doesn't because he knows the girl from the park won't call him an adult.

The girl from the park still doesn't tell him her name, so he decides to call her sunflower. 

One day Rahma decides she wants out of their little circle. She cares about her appearance now when she didn't before. He prompts her for a reason.
"One day when you like someone you'll understand"

He wants to scream that he likes someone and does not understand. He doesn't though, watching her walk away as he wonders what this crushing feeling in his chest is, he is not sure what it is, so he doesn't. He doesn't cry on his way home , he only does when his mom hugs him  and he doesn't feel warm, he cries becaue he is angry, friendless, lonely and lost.

---

When he is 9 he goes to the park and sees a sight that saps the world of all its colors.

It's sunflower girl but tjere is no sunshine where she sits. With her as the subject and the world as the backdrop it makes for an ugly painting. Her eyes are blood red and the sky is grey.

He looks and her lips tremble and she cries. Wet grass balling in between her fingers, breaking nad scattering. Taku realizes he has never seen her cry. 

"What's wrong? Are you hurt anywhere?" He asks softly because this is what his mom says whenever he is hurt because figuring out the source of the pain makes it easier to heal.

His friend isn't bleeding but she keeps crying, her body shakes with a loud ache.

An ugly emotion festers in his heart. It's anger.

---

He says hello to both of his friends at school, indvidually because the girls don't talk to each other.

But they'd always greet the silent fair skinned boy  with no friends and he feels something weird in his guts. It's jealousy. Taku doesn't think he likes jealousy.

Soon, sunflower girl doesn't talk to him anymore. One day he decides to consult his potted bonsai tree because nature doesn't lie.

The bonsai insists she loves him. So, he waits patiently for when she's ready to be his friend again.

---

Rahma begins talking to him again, its not like she really stopped before. He asks after sunflower girl and Rahma doesn't know.

When she replies  though it takes the conversation in a totally differnet direction.

"You don't know her" She warns

"I want to" He says and hates how small his voice is as he says it making it seem like a request and not something he really wants. "I.Want.To" He tries again, stressing the words more because he now knows that stressed words make more of an impact.

It doesn't work

"Trust me, you don't"

She looks at him tiredly  and walks away. They don't talk about this again.

---

Sunflower's Dad passes away when they are 10. 

This time when he tries to console her, she lets him and she begins talking to him again.

---

As surely as the seasons change, time passes and soon they are eleven then twelve.

Seven months before the dreams hit him, sunflower girl bleeds for the first time.

Taku panics and cries, thinking she's sat on a nail, she doesn't, it makes for a rather comic scene, people laugh, Taku doesn't care.

She finally tells him her name because she thinks "Sunflower you are bleeding" sounds wrong, so she tells him her name.

*Fatima* Taku repeats her name in his head. He thinks it's a beautiful name.

He likes it.

---

Now he is thirteen, has graduated middle school and sorta writes. Which is a false advertisement really, since he is not a writer just yet, an avid reader though he is and he writes snippets every once in a while.

His stories tend to be about three things, scattered in messy notion pages and on stacks of paper. The big bang; the beginning where people stumble into each other, the middle(people talking around the corner because he has not learned about conflicts yet); where the universe breathes life into planets and the end(where people shake hands and nothing happens); where the universe reverts to the state before the beginning as though nothing had ever happened.

*The kid means well but goes about it the wrong way his dad says*

A month after deciding to focus on his writing he fails to write anything meaningful, so he decides he needs real life experiences to draw from and sets off to the city park. Getting there he gets  on the first bike he sees and tries cycling; it’s a fish out of water situation.

“You’re horrible at this”, a voice he is sure is female says after a beat, voice delightful even when he’s sure she’s been watching a terrible sight as he struggles and fails to keep the bike upright on repeat. She looks older or the makeup she wears makes her look older, her biking apparel is a mix of blue and white colors and he realizes ever so painfully that the bike he is sitting on with its matching colorway is most likely hers. “Get off and give me your hands”.

He follows.

The first thought that occurs to him as she holds his hand is how incredibly like his mom’s her palm is; warm and soft.

She looks at him with a teasing look in her eyes.

*oh.* He thinks. A hundred creative thoughts forcing their way into his thoughts.

“No need to hold on *that* tight”.  She laughs and his brains decides to burn that sound to a template because its beautiful. He likes the way this  seems so cinematic in his head, a zen feeling being waxed into his mind “I’m not going anywhere you know”

He decidedly feels on top of the world when she doesn’t let go

---

She has a name, *Fatima*, he remembers and he decides to paint a picture of her with words, deciding the picture is wrong when the words paint something unremarkable and he knows she is not.

---

He decides to write a book about him and her, naming the first page moonlight, because she evokes in him a feeling similar to when he watches the moon. He feels alot of pride for taking this step and it makes him watch the world go on.


---

They practice, she instructing and he listening. They practice during the cool evenings and in the cold mornings.
One such cold morning she notices him shivering.

"Here take my scarf" She shares with him a half of her heart.

The thing does give him strength

---
He decides he needs new ideas, heads to his parents bookshelf and picks the first book he sees.

The book is a modern day portrayal of the deities susanoo(Japanese god of storms) and tsukuyomi(Japanese goddess of the moon). He thinks it’s perfect.

---

He reads it randomly and out of order because a nonlinear narrative is something he has come to appreciate. 

His train of thought has never been the tidiest sort

*A fortnight after setting sail, the angry god susanoo stirs up a storm, which nearly drags Taku - the hero, under undefeatable white waves and blue water. He almost drowns, but he doesn’t. The world is suddenly cast into darkness. Then a goddess comes*

Her name is Fatima. It’s euphoric, finally seeing real-life woven with fiction the way every great writer does in literature and fiction. She’s a goddess and he can be the hero too someday.

---

Now he is 14 and Fatima often shifts through hues and shades, trying to find the perfect color palette to paint the picture that is her life, because this is the age to do such things.

All good stories are about the arcs, the slight changes in an otherwise boring storyline - his friend Salma tells him one day.

He decides he doesn’t like change

---

Now he is in High School and they go to the same school. 

Their class is of two partitions and she belongs to one while he belongs to the other. She invites him to lunch one day and tells him to come along with his friends. He does and they have fun, the girls invite them over for the next day, this he knows is inevitable because they've met the amazing existence that is Khaleefa. 

He tries to do something about the magnetic effect khaleefa's presence has and doesn't succeed, that is not to say nothing comes of it since he manages to look foolish.

His friend's keeps glancing in the direction of Rahma, a girl with a voice like japanese bamboo flutes, all chimes and soothing to Khaleefa not that Taku notices

Fatima's eyes, dark like the night sky never look in his direction and he dies a little. 

He gets home and tells himself he won't write about today's events, but then he remembers Salma's words about good stories and how they are made of arcs; some beautiful and some sorrowful, so he writes.

*His knees gave way and his arms fell slack, the sea sapping him of all his strength. His bones ache and his flesh is swollen. So he lay there, breathless with barely enough energy to stir.*


---

One day Mubarak asks the question he has no courage to ask. "Isn't this a bother?. I thought you hate such things"

Khaleefa shrugs and taku is pretty sure he dies more inside when Khaleefa says smiling "Not really. Not when you like someone"

He doesn't know Khaleefa is thinking of Rahma as he says this. What he does know is that like him, Khaleefa is a lonely person, so he automatically thinks Khaleefa is also attracted by Fatima's warm presence.

---

This is torture he decides.

---

Conflicts are meant to be driven by negative emotions borne with the aim of protecting the positive ones, they are meant to leave behind a trail of bloody tears and broken hearts; still he can't bring himself to hate anyone in this story.

Taku hates the way his hands shake; yearning for the soothing feeling of her palm, he hates how his voice wavers trying to call out to her.
*Calypso opens her arms, her expression is an offer: make your home with me, and be immortal, no matter how much you long to see that wife you yearn for day after day.*

His palms clench

---

The scarf she gave him that cold morning is still in his closet.

*And here take my veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted and you can come to no harm so long as you wear it*

He does not feel so invincible anymore.

---

On his sixteenth birthday, Khaleefa who is all muted colors comes in first, a burst of red colors on him appearing out of nowhere. Taku gapes and stares.

Without a word the story becomes clearer. Rahma comes in a second later with a matching red scarf.

---

"You're too obvious y'know?" Fatima says when they're at the doorstep, then sitting on a couch, then saying goodbye.

"It has always been her and him" He can't help but notice the sombre undertone in her voice.

---

Outside, it's cold and fog limits visibility, he offers her a ride in his dad's car. He is silent the whole ride.
When he drops her off, out of habit, he blurts her name as she is opening the door to her parent's house, she turns and her eyes have a curious glint to them. A ray of moonlight hits her face and he forgets to breath, the only thought running through his head being of how right he was to have depicted her as the moon goddess in his book.

His voice catches in his throat, he remembers his mom's words of the simple truth being a form of beauty and he decides he doesn't need any more beautiful words than the truth already contains, so he blurts "Can I tell you that I love you?"

She stares then pauses, then her lips curl into a soft yes.

---

*She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had since been raised to the rank of a celestial goddess*

He decides he does not need extra ordinarily beautiful words. He has yet to know the ending of this story but he knows it wont be like the ending of the universe where everything reverts like nothing ever happened

---
**Cancer**

They are 37 years old and she is on the bed in their shared room, wrapped in blue sheets that seem to wrap around her as though protecting her from harm, but he knows better, even now as he watches the cancer is inside her eating away at her, killing her slowly.  

“Promise me you are going to be alright”

He loves her eyes, wide and round like a doe’s. They always look at him with admiration, even when he thinks lowly of himself. They gaze upon him and he sees understanding, not a single shred of judgement present in them. They remind him who he really is; a kind soul, a brave heart, and a misunderstood heart and mind. He often loses himself in her eyes because they remind him of his life, of a life filled  with pain, loneliness, turmoil and frustration, but they also present a window into her and he sees her for who she is, a woman of strong will and intelligence,  of eyes filled with kindness and a heart filled with love for family, friends and for him. Most importantly though, they remind him of his vow to her and himself to do everything in his power to ensure those eyes never shed another tear of sorrow, only joy. He may not be able to fulfil that vow now.

“Hey…” Her voice breaks at the end, a violent shudder running through her body, making her cough .  “Please.”

“No”

He loves her hands, small, dainty and delicate. Soft in their caress of his skin. Comforting in their touches and embrace. He loves when they pat his head to assure him that everything would be alright. They are graceful when she sketches new architectural plans. Teasing when they bop him on the nose.

“I know what you are playing at. I won’t let you sway me. Not today”

He loves her lips. They are plump, rosy and beautiful. He likes stealing kisses from them. She giggles whenever he kisses her nose, she smiles when he tries and fails to be chivalrous, she laughs when he kisses her stomach.

“I can’t leave you like this”, she says.

“Then don’t leave.”

He loves her voice. It is soft and comforting. He remembers how it used to be whisper-like when they were kids, she would stutter due to her shyness. He remembers how he encouraged her to talk more, to speak her mind, this he did because people think her weak and useless but also because he loves listening to her voice. It is music to his ears, his favorite melody, he especially loves when she says his name because no one does it better.

“Don’t make it harder than this has to be”

He loves her skin. It is the finest shade of a color he doesn’t quite have a name for yet, all he knows is that it is an exquisite color that seats between ivory and brown. Actually, it does have a name but acknowledging it would mean accepting that there is something else that is colored the same as the divine treasure that is her skin, so he refuses, he doesn’t acknowledge it.

“Harder than it has to be, I’m not the one giving up here”

The sunlight creeps in and kisses her on the cheek and for a second he forgets to breath. She looks like a goddess descended to take his sanity, she would take his heart too but those are hers to begin with.

“You know I never give up”

“It sure sounds like that though”. He knows that his words cause her pain and he hates himself for it,  he hates himself for making it seem like he doubts her love. But he can’t shake her to make her see sense, so he remains seated on the bedside chair and continues to stare at her with anger written all over his face. She doesn’t say anything in reply and he wishes she would, he wishes she would scream, shout, just do anything to break the silence, he has always thought that silence is the sound of punishment, but for once in his life he really feels as if he is being punished by the silence, this silence that makes him feel as if he is the greek titan Atlas, bearing the weight of the world on his back. He thought he is no more afraid of battles, but now he is at war with his wife and that scares him more than anything.

“Hey…”

“Hey..I’m begging you. Don’t do this to me. Don’t leave me because I can’t live without you”

He stares at her unblinking, willing her to look away. She doesn’t, instead raising a hand gently to place on his cheek.

“When I was younger, I used to act unbothered by people’s comments and gestures only to go cry in the privacy of my room because I was so scared, I nearly chose the wrong path, but you with your willingness to always sacrifice your happiness if it meant I could smile, you saved me. So I changed, I still cried in the privacy of my room but now I had no reason to be something I wasn’t, with you I could cry, smile and laugh. With you I could be myself and ultimately that saved me. I’m afraid too, but if I die, I would do so knowing I lived a happy life. I love you too.”

She smiles and for the second time that night, he forgets how to breath. She always does this to him, always brings him back from the edge. She is a mystery to him, a puzzle he has given his all to solve but simply can’t.

“I will never give up, never doubt that. I am going through chemotherapy now and I have faith that Allah will cure me. But I’m not the little girl who couldn’t face her demons anymore. I know that this may take my life and I want you to know that if that happens, I want to leave you and the kids with no regrets”

Her gentle smile hurts him, but it is like the sun rising and breaking the nightlong rule of the moon. His heart misses a beat and the world comes to a standstill. He doesn’t fight the silence and it defeats him in a second. He imagines a life without her and all he can see is darkness. Then she blinks and the world takes a step forward. Warmth spreads in his body, chasing away the icy cold in his veins and he feels a smile tug at his lips.

"You are the woman of my dreams," he says while his hand find its way to her hair.

"I will always love you. Even if you are in Heaven and I'm still down here, I'll love you. I'll love you until I take my last breath and beyond that. I'll love you until the stars burn out. I’d love you for a lifetime and more" She shivers.

When he was younger, his mom told him that love doesn’t have a time limit, it has no expiration date she said. When he was younger, it made no sense. Now he is older and he knows that when you love a person, you love them for a lifetime and more

He embraces her as if the world was ending and she holds him tight like a warrior fighting for her life. Silvery tears run down their faces with the same ferocity of cascading waterfalls flowing down mountains. He embraces her and he never lets her go.

He has won the battle but he hasn't won the war. Death still wants her. But now he knows what he never should have doubted in the first place: she hasn't given up. And she never would.

And for tonight, that is enough.

### Author's Note:

Hello, this is theMaskedOtaku or otakus3nnin if you would, anyone you prefer. Thanks for reading this, thamk you to my friends Salma and Ahruf. This piece is very 
special to me because the main character is someone whose struggles I can relate to partly due to him being autistic and his story(Some parts of it parallels mine save 
for some embellishments). Ever since I was six years old, I suffer from momentary bouts of depression and extreme anxiety, my mom also told me that growing up I used 
to suddenly become sombre. Last year after the pandemic, I decided to do something about it, so I joined a forum. One day I decided to speak about my experiences, 
after reading what I had written, someone said I might be suffering from autism and suggested I sign up for a psychoanalysis session. I signed up, did the 
psychoanalysis session and the verdict was "I would declare you autistic but I think that you lack some core defining traits, this is a rather interesting case since 
you still happen to be neurodivergent". What you may not know is that autism is a form of neurodivergence, so while my struggles may not be the same as that of 
autisitic people, they are quite similar
